= Spring Security Maven Plugin

Spring Security Maven Plugin is a Gradle plugin that provides tasks for publishing releases to Maven Central (Sonatype) and Spring (Artifactory) repositories.

To use the plugin, apply the plugin in your project's root `build.gradle` and in each sub-module that requires publishing artifacts:

[source,gradle]
----
plugins {
	id "io.spring.security.maven" version "1.0.4"
}
----

== Overview

This plugin has two main goals:

1. Automatically apply plugins and configuration for publishing artifacts to both Maven Central (Sonatype) and Spring (Artifactory).
2. Provide tasks for automatically choosing which artifact repository to publish artifacts to based on the project version.

This plugin performs the following on the root project:

* Applies the `io.github.gradle-nexus.publish-plugin` plugin
* Creates an `ossrh` repository for publishing artifacts to the Sonatype staging repository
* Configures the `publishArtifacts` task to publish releases to the Sonatype staging repository (`ossrh`)
* Configures the `finalizeDeployArtifacts` task to close and release any opened staging repository (for Sonatype releases only)

This plugin also performs the following on each sub-module it is applied to:

* Applies the `maven-publish` plugin
* Applies the `signing` plugin
* Applies the `com.jfrog.artifactory` plugin
* Creates a `mavenJava` publication with the `java` component
* Configures the `signing` extension using gradle properties
* Configures the `publishing` extension to sign artifacts
* Creates a `local` repository for publishing artifacts to a local directory
* Configures the `artifactory` extension using gradle properties
* Configures the `publishArtifacts` task to publish snapshots, milestones and release candidates to Artifactory

== Task Reference

=== `publishArtifacts`

This task works together with `finalizeDeployArtifacts` to publish artifacts to the appropriate artifact repository and automatically close and release staging repositories (for Sonatype releases only) once publishing is complete.

For snapshots, milestones , and release candidates (e.g. `-SNAPSHOT`, `-M1`, `-RC1`, etc.), Artifactory is used.
For releases (any other version), the Sonatype staging repository is used instead.

The default Nexus URL is `https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/service/local/`, which is for the Sonatype staging repository.
You can override this by passing the optional environment variable `OSSRH_URL`.

The default Nexus snapshots URL is `https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`.
You can override this by passing the optional environment variable `OSSRH_SNAPSHOT_REPOSITORY_URL`.

The default Artifactory URL is `https://repo.spring.io`.
You can override this by passing the optional environment variable `ARTIFACTORY_URL`.

*Example:*

[source,bash]
----
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingKey=...
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingPassword=...
OSSRH_USERNAME=...
OSSRH_PASSWORD=...
ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=...
ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=...
./gradlew publishArtifacts finalizeDeployArtifacts -PossrhUsername="$OSSRH_USERNAME" -PossrhPassword="$OSSRH_PASSWORD" -PartifactoryUsername="$ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME" -PartifactoryPassword="$ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD" --stacktrace
----

== `publishToOssrh`

This task is provided by the `maven-publish` plugin when the `ossrh` repository is defined, and can be used directly to publish snapshots and other artifacts to the Sonatype staging repository.

[NOTE]
====
You will need to call `closeAndReleaseOssrhStagingRepository` yourself.
====

*Example:*

[source,bash]
----
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingKey=...
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingPassword=...
OSSRH_USERNAME=...
OSSRH_PASSWORD=...
./gradlew publishToOssrh closeAndReleaseOssrhStagingRepository -PossrhUsername="$OSSRH_USERNAME" -PossrhPassword="$OSSRH_PASSWORD" --stacktrace
----

== `artifactoryPublish`

This task is provided by the `com.jfrog.artifactory` plugin, and can be used directly to publish artifacts (including releases) to Artifactory.

*Example:*

[source,bash]
----
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingKey=...
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingPassword=...
ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=...
ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=...
./gradlew artifactoryPublish -PartifactoryUsername="$ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME" -PartifactoryPassword="$ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD" --stacktrace
----

== `publishToMavenLocal`

This task is provided by the `maven-publish` plugin, and can be used directly to publish artifacts to the local Maven cache for testing.

*Example:*

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

== `publishMavenJavaPublicationToLocalRepository`

This task is provided by the `maven-publish` plugin when the `local` repository is defined, and can be used directly to publish artifacts to a local directory (`build/publication/repos`) for testing.

*Example:*

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publishMavenJavaPublicationToLocalRepository
----
