= Release Guidelines

A release happens on the appropriate `releases/vX` branch.
That is, when releasing `v1`, release from `releases/v1` using the "Build and Deploy" action.

Then forward-merge using `-s ours` from `releases/vX` to each subsequent `releases/vY` branch and finally `main`.
When complete, merge the `releases/vX` branch into the `v1` branch.
